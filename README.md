# WSBEditor

**[Launch the latest version of WSBEditor](https://leesteve.tk/WSBEditor/WSBEditor.html).**

WSBEditor is a web-based [Windows Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview) configuration file (*.wsb) editor.

- Lightweight
- Runs directly from browser
- No installation required

## Compatibility

WSBEditor creates Windows Sandbox configuration files, which are compatible with any system:
- Running Windows 10 **build 18342** or later; and
- With **Windows Sandbox feature** enabled

WSBEditor itself is a web application - it may run on **any browser** (including on your phone!!) but you will need a PC to use the configuration file.

## Support or Contact

WSBEditor is a work in progress (actually my little attempt at coding while staying-at-home during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)).

Please feel free to support the project or report any issues at our [GitHub page](https://github.com/leestevetk/WSBEditor).
