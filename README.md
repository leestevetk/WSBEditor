# WSBEditor

**[Launch the latest version of WSBEditor](https://leesteve.tk/WSBEditor/WSBEditor.html).**

WSBEditor is a web-based [Windows Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview) configuration file (*.wsb) editor.

- Lightweight (_Single File Only_)
- Runs directly from browser
- No installation required

## How to Use

You may **[launch the latest version of WSBEditor](https://leesteve.tk/WSBEditor/WSBEditor.html)** directly (recommended) or you may download WSBEditor for offline use.

## Compatibility

WSBEditor creates Windows Sandbox configuration files, which are compatible with any system:
- Running **Windows 10 build 18342** or later; and
- With **Windows Sandbox feature** enabled

WSBEditor itself is a simple web app - it runs on **any browser** (including on your phone!!) but you will need a PC to use configuration files generated by WSBEditor.

## Support or Contact

WSBEditor is a work in progress (actually my little attempt at coding while staying-at-home during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)).
